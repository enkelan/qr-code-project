Hello i finished this fun project it took me 2 days to actually understand how to properly aling the text inside the white border and center every thing how it is demanded

Websites i used to get information out of: https://www.w3schools.com/ https://www.freecodecamp.org/ youtube.com

This 3 websites have helped me figuring out on how to tackle this project

Again i look forward into tackling other challenges and can't wait for my mind to explode again :D
